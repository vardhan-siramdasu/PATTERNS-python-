# patterns

Preparing for technical interviews takes a lot of preparation, and it’s highly probable that you might have to create Python pattern programs there. That’s why I’ve sorted a list of multiple ideas for pattern printing in Python to start your preparations. 

We have multiple kinds of Python pattern programs in this list, so choose your expertise and experience. Make sure that you understand what part of code does what before you move onto the next pattern. Without a proper understanding of how the system works, you would face a lot of difficulty in explaining its working.

Many times, the interviewer asks for an explanation of how you performed pattern printing in Python. Knowing how everything works will help you in answering those questions effectively. 

You’ll find the Python code along with every pattern below:
